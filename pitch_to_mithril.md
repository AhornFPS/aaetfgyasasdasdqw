# Pitch / Permission Request for "Planetside Companion"

Dear Mithril,

I am writing to you today to request permission and clarification regarding a community tool we have been developing for *PlanetSide 2*, tentatively called **Planetside Companion** or **Better Planetside**. 

Our goal with this project is to enhance the gameplay experience for players by providing a modern, customizable overlay that tracks their performance in real-time, purely using legitimate data sources. We want to ensure that this tool is 100% compliant with Daybreak Games' Terms of Service and does not trigger any anti-cheat measures.

### How it Works
The tool is an external application (Python/Qt) that runs alongside the game. It **does not** inject code, read game memory, or modify game files in any way.

It relies on:
1.  **The Daybreak Census API (WebSocket):** To track character stats, kills, deaths, and experience events in real-time.
2.  **Screen Overlay:** A transparent window placed over the game (in Borderless/Windowed mode) to display information.

### Key Features
*   **Killfeed:** A visual log of recent kills/deaths/assists (similar to the in-game chat but more visual).
*   **Session Stats:** Real-time calculation of K/D, KPM, HSR, and other metrics.
*   **Custom Crosshair:** A static overlay for a custom crosshair (center of screen entitlement).
*   **Voice Macros:** Automated voice callouts triggered by in-game events (optional feature).

### Why we are asking
We want to share this tool with the community, but strict compliance is our top priority. Before we release this publicly, we would like to ask:
1.  Are there any specific features we should disable or modify to remain in good standing?
2.  Do you need to code from us to check it should i give you our github link?
3.  Do you have any name ideas for the tool or should we pick one of the above?

It is conceptually similar to the "Recursion Stats Tracker," but designed to be newer, more modern, and simpler to use.

We have put a lot of work into making this a polished experience for veteran players or new players, and we would love to get your blessing (or guidance) to ensure it is safe for everyone to use.

Thank you for your time and for your work with the community!

Best regards,

Cedric12354 & Ahorn
